### `tidyverse`

-   What it is: A collection of R packages designed for data science.

-   It bundles together popular packages like:

-   dplyr → data manipulation (filter, select, group, summarise).

-   ggplot2 → data visualization.

-   readr → reading CSVs and text files.

-   tibble → a modern data frame format.

-   tidyr → reshaping and cleaning data (pivoting, spreading).

Why we use it: Instead of base R functions (which can be clunky), tidyverse gives you clean, consistent, and human-readable syntax.

```         
# with tidyverse (dplyr)
gym %>% group_by(difficulty) %>% summarise(avg_reps = mean(reps))

# in base R
aggregate(gym$reps, by=list(gym$difficulty), FUN=mean)
```

### `janitor`

-   **What it is**: A small package with convenience functions for **cleaning messy data**.

-   **Key feature**: `clean_names()`

    -   It standardizes messy column names into snake_case (e.g., `"Exercise Name (Type)"` → `"exercise_name_type"`).

-   Also has functions like:

    -   `tabyl()` → quick frequency tables.

    -   `remove_empty()` → drop empty rows/columns.

**Why we use it**:\
Real-world data often comes with spaces, capitals, or special characters in column names. Cleaning names makes your code easier and less error-prone.
